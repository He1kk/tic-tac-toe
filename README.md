The application was created in Windows Forms in C# in the Visual Studio program.
When the application is launched, the game starts automatically.
The winner is the one who is the first to line up 3 of his figures vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
Zero goes first, but if you want, you can walk with a cross by selecting it in the "Motion" section.
After the end of the game, a window appears with a notification of the victory of one of the parties, and the winner's field is repainted green.
